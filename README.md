# **SerieslyTracked** üé¨  

This is a simple project I built to **track the movies and TV shows I'm watching**, keeping track of seasons and episodes without overcomplicating things.  

## **Why I Made This**  
I just wanted a clean and minimal way to manage my watchlist. Most existing apps have extra features I don‚Äôt need, so I made something that works exactly how I want it to.  

## Live Demo
https://seriesly-tracked.netlify.app/

## **Features**  
- **Search & Add** movies/shows (via API or manually)  
- **Track Progress** (update seasons/episodes easily)  
- **Mark as Completed** (greys out & disables controls)  
- **Local Storage Support** (keeps data saved)  
- **Minimal UI** with a dark theme  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI   
- **Storage:** Local Storage  
- **API:** OMDb API (Movies), TVMaze API (Series)  

## **Setup & Usage**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**  
```sh
npm install
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Start Development Server**  
```sh
npm run dev
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Build for Production**

```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy on Netlify**  
I‚Äôm hosting it on Netlify, so if I ever need to re-deploy:  
- Drag the `dist` folder to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)  
- Or use GitHub with:  
  - **Build Command:** `npm run build`  
  - **Publish Directory:** `dist`
